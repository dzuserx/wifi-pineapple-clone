The PineAP Suite includes modules for capturing and analyzing wireless traffic, creating rogue access points, performing man-in-the-middle attacks, and conducting network reconnaissance. The PineAP module can be used to create a fake access point to lure devices to connect to it, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive information such as login credentials and other data. |                   0 | PineAP                                   | Maintain existing PineAP modules and add missing items (card and nav-item : subsections or sub-modules, sub-modules or sub-sections navigation bar, ...) from the corresponding description                      | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | nan                                                              | nan                                                                                       | nan                                                   | nan                                                                                 | nan                                                          | nan                                                                                  |

It provides a comprehensive set of tools for scanning the surrounding WiFi environment and gathering information such as the names (SSIDs) of nearby access points, their channels, encryption types, and signal strengths. The Recon module can also detect connected client devices, their vendor information, and probe requests, and can also perform de-authentication attacks to disconnect client devices from their access points.  |                   0 | Recon                                    | - missing Wireless landscape card and graphs                                                                                                                                                                     | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | nan                                                              | nan                                                                                       | nan                                                   | nan                                                                                 | nan                                                          | nan                                                                                  |
